##Health pharmacy insight.

The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of hospital pharmacy performance across counties, departments, and patient demographics. The results highlight key patterns in disease prevalence, revenue generation, cost distribution, and operational efficiency that support informed decision-making.

The analysis shows that certain diseases consistently account for the highest number of patient visits across multiple counties. These high-volume conditions drive overall hospital activity and significantly influence pharmacy demand. Trend evaluation over time indicates relatively stable patterns for chronic illnesses, while some conditions display periodic fluctuations, suggesting potential seasonal effects. Understanding these patterns enables better planning of pharmaceutical inventory and staffing requirements.

Although there is a general positive relationship between total patient visits and pharmacy revenue, the relationship is not perfectly proportional. Some counties with high visit volumes generate comparatively lower revenue per visit, indicating lower-cost treatments or standardized medication protocols. Conversely, certain departments manage fewer patients but generate higher revenue due to specialized treatments or more expensive drug categories. This demonstrates that revenue performance depends not only on volume but also on treatment complexity and medication type.

Department-level comparisons reveal that pharmacy costs are concentrated in specific clinical units. Higher costs are often associated with departments treating chronic or complex cases, which require sustained medication management. However, elevated spending does not necessarily indicate inefficiency. Instead, it may reflect necessary clinical practices aligned with patient care standards.

Age group analysis further reveals that older patients contribute the largest share of pharmacy consumption. Individuals aged 56 and above show higher medication spending, likely due to chronic condition management and multiple prescriptions. Younger age groups, while contributing to visit numbers, generally demonstrate lower pharmacy expenditure per visit.

Finally, the relationship between length of hospital stay and pharmacy spending varies across diagnoses. Some conditions are associated with extended stays but moderate medication costs, possibly reflecting observation-based or supportive care. Others show shorter stays combined with higher pharmacy spending, likely due to intensive or high-cost drug therapies.

Overall, the dashboard supports strategic resource allocation, cost monitoring, and improved financial planning. By integrating operational and financial indicators, hospital management can enhance efficiency, optimize inventory decisions, and maintain quality patient care while ensuring long-term sustainability.
